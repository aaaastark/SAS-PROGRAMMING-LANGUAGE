# SAS-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE
The SAS language is a computer programming language used for statistical analysis, created by Anthony James Barr at North Carolina State University. It can read in data from common spreadsheets and databases and output the results of statistical analyses in tables, graphs, and as RTF, HTML and PDF documents. The SAS language runs under compilers that can be used on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and various other UNIX and mainframe computers. The SAS System and World Programming System (WPS) are SAS language compilers.
